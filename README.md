I made and tested this using a flipper zero and tested it on windows 11 and 10

Just plug the bad USB in, run it. Once the Start screen appers, leave it another few secconds till it tabs out then in

For it to work properly close the SNAKE game tab to ensure the code finishes it's completion and delets all of the files it created
